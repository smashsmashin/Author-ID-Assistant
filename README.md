# Author-ID-Assistant

## Overview

The Author-ID-Assistant is a security-focused Android application designed to enhance the security of your Author-ID Key FOB by intelligently managing its accessibility. For critical security reasons, this assistant ensures your Key FOB is enabled only for a short, thirty-second window after your phone is placed unlocked into the car's wireless charging tray, or for the first successful unlock during a wireless charging session. For added security, the Key FOB is disabled on every unlock if the phone is not currently wireless charging.

This application operates discreetly in the background, requiring specific user-granted permissions for its functionality.

## Features

*   **Conditional Key FOB Activation:** Automatically enables Author-ID Key FOB for a limited time (30 seconds) upon specific unlock conditions related to wireless charging.
*   **Enhanced Security:** Disables Key FOB when not actively charging or unlocking under the specified conditions.
*   **Background Operation:** Works seamlessly in the background without a user interface.
*   **Secure by Design:** Focuses on providing enhanced security for your Author-ID Key FOB.

## Permissions Required

This application requires the following permissions to be manually granted by the user, as it does not have a user interface:

*   **Accessibility Service:** This permission is used solely to launch the "Author ID" application and to activate/deactivate the Key FOB.
*   **Notification Access:** This permission is utilized to detect the active state of the Key FOB by monitoring the notification of the foreground service. The foreground service is initiated when the Key FOB is activated and terminated when the Key FOB is deactivated.

**Note:** Granting these permissions is essential for the app to function as intended. Instructions on how to grant these permissions can typically be found in your device's Accessibility and Notification Access settings.
